# Recommender-Systems---Neural-Collaborative-Filtering

The NCF paper can be found here - https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031


This Notebook presents Collaborative Filtering through Neural Networks. The key points are discusses below - 
1. Download the MovieLens Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset - download only rating.csv.
2. Due to very large data, we have used only 30% of the data (which is still large).
3. The notebook employs NCF model which is a combination of Matrix Factorization(MF) & Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP).
4. We use Hit-Ratio as an evaluation metric for testing the accuracy of the Recommender System.
